# Canary Identity System

A cloud identity **deception** system. It plants realistic-but-fake AWS
credentials where an attacker would find them, and when one is used it detects
the use, classifies it against MITRE ATT&CK, profiles the attacker's behaviour,
reconstructs the attack timeline, and alerts - in seconds.

Because a canary identity has **no legitimate use**, any activity involving one
is malicious by definition. That is what makes this a zero-false-positive
detection rather than another anomaly-scoring tool.

## How the detection works

Four stages, each independently testable:

1. **Analyze** (`analyzer.py`) - normalise the CloudTrail record, map the API
   action to an ATT&CK technique, fingerprint the client from its user-agent
   (Pacu, CloudFox, raw `curl`, browser, SDK), extract the target resource, and
   raise detection signals. Severity is the maximum of the technique's own
   severity and every signal raised.

2. **Correlate** (`timeline.py`) - pivot on source IP **and** access key **and**
   principal ARN, query the last 24 hours of CloudTrail through CloudWatch Logs
   Insights or Athena, and fold the results into contiguous kill-chain phases.
   Pivoting on all three catches both a credential moving between hosts and an
   attacker escalating into a different role.

3. **Profile** (`profiler.py`) - measure call velocity, inter-event jitter
   (scripted tooling has a near-constant cadence; humans do not), the
   `AccessDenied` ratio (a permission sweep is mostly denials), tactic coverage
   and IP spread. Produces a behaviour label and a 0-100 risk score in which
   **every point carries a stated reason**.

4. **Alert** (`alerter.py`) - render to Slack Block Kit, a Discord embed, generic
   JSON for a SIEM, or the console. Formatters are pure functions; only
   `dispatch()` touches the network, and a dead sink is reported rather than
   raised.

Full rationale in [docs/detection-engine.md](docs/detection-engine.md).

## Design decisions

- **Zero runtime dependencies.** The engine uses only the standard library
  (`urllib` for webhooks, `statistics` for profiling). `src/` zips directly into
  a Lambda package - no vendoring, no layer, no cold-start penalty. `boto3` is
  imported lazily and only when a log backend is actually queried, so the test
  suite needs neither AWS credentials nor the SDK.
- **Fail open, never silent.** A timed-out log query, an unreachable webhook or a
  malformed record is recorded in the output and the alert still fires with what
  is known. Losing an alert is worse than losing an enrichment.
- **Suppression instead of filtering.** Non-canary events are still analysed and
  logged, just marked `suppressed`. The EventBridge rule can be over-broad
  without producing false alerts.
- **Attacker-controlled input is untrusted.** Source IPs and ARNs end up inside
  log queries, so pivot values are sanitised before query construction
  (`tests/test_timeline.py` asserts this).

## Deployment

See [docs/integration-contract.md](docs/integration-contract.md) for the Lambda
handler path, required IAM permissions, environment variables, accepted input
shapes and the canary-naming requirement.

```bash
make package                  # -> terraform/lambda_payload.zip (handler: handler.lambda_handler)
cd terraform && terraform init && terraform apply
```

<!-- Person A: infrastructure setup steps (terraform vars, CloudTrail prerequisites,
     seeding the honeytokens) go here. -->

## Validation

End-to-end red/blue test once both halves are deployed:

```bash
# Red team - use the planted credential
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile canary
aws s3 ls --profile canary

# Blue team - watch the detection fire
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/canary-identity-detector --follow
```

## Cost

Everything runs inside the AWS Always Free tier: CloudTrail management events
(first copy free), EventBridge (1M events/month), Lambda (1M requests/month),
CloudWatch Logs (5 GB/month), IAM (always free). Set a $1 zero-spend budget
alert and keep CloudTrail on **management events only** - data events bill per
object.
